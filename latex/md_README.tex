Eight Queens problem solution checker, developed using Test Driven Development.

This function reads a file with a 0s ans 1s, where 0s represents empty squares and 1s represent squares with queens.

You must have eight queens placed on the board, if you don\textquotesingle{}t the function will fail and return -\/1.

If you provide an invalid board the function will fail and return -\/1.

If you provided a valid board but an invalid solution for the problem, i.\+e. at least one queen threaten another, the function will return 0.

If you provided a valid board and a valid solution, the function will return 1.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{How to Run}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
